# Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¼

This project showcases a supervised machine learning model built to classify iris flowers into three speciesâ€”Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginicaâ€”based on their petal and sepal dimensions. Developed during my Data Science internship, the project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization using Python and popular libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## Demo Video ðŸŽ¬

This video walks through the Iris Flower Classification project, highlighting:
- Dataset overview and feature explanation
- Data preprocessing steps
- Model selection and training (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, or Decision Tree)
- Accuracy evaluation and confusion matrix
- Visualizations of classification results

The demo reflects the practical skills gained during my Data Science internship, including working with real datasets, applying machine learning algorithms, and interpreting model performance.
